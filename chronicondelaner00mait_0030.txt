ξ 11. The Chronicle‚ with a few exceptions, appears to be an
original composition. Towards its eommencement, it embodies
some passages taken from the Chronicle of Melrose, which it
cites as a certain Scottish book of AnnaIS, (p. 15.) Many of
its notices concerning papal affairs, chiefly as to the elections of
the popes and the duration of their pontificateS, are transcribed
from the Chronicle of Martinus Polanus. The remarks con-

under the year 1219, are copied almost verbatim from a work
printed in the collection, by Bo'ngars, entitled Gesta. Dei per
Francos, (ii. 208.) Beyond these, it is believed that no further

passageS, at least of any extent, can be traced to other sources.

them, from the peculial· nature of the abbreviations employed,

abounding in misreadings3 but all these copies having been
