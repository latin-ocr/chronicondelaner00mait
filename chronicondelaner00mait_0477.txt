NOTES. 435

Raynaldi, Am. 1340, ξ 33, where the date is preserved, by which we find that it was
not issued until loth November.

“ Universorum Dominus, rex excelsus, cui licet sit in potestate voluntas,'' p. 328.
See another copy in the Foedera, p. 1109, where it is printed from the Rotuli

Franciae.

“ . . . litteras excusatorias de ingressu et invasione regni Franciae summo pontifici de·
mandavit‚” p. 332.

The public announcement which he made upon this occasion is perhaps the instru-
ment printed at p. 29& the private letter sent to the pope has not reached us. The
answer of Benedict is preserved by Raynaldi, ΑΛ). 1340, ξ 4, in which his holiness
brings sorward many arguments to induce Edward to abandon his projected attempt
upon the French crown.

The arrangement of the documenta here inserted in the Chronicle of Lanercost is
very faulty, bnt the succession of events with which they are connected may easily
be established by a reference to the pages of Rymer and Raynaldi. lt appears from
the latter ot' these authorities that Edward dispatched to Rome, along with the docu—
ment printed at p. 326, an embassy consisting of William de Norwich, dean of Lin-
coln‚ John de Offorde, archdeacon of Ely, and John de Thoresby, canon of Southwell.
who presented to the pope a statement drawn up for the purpose of convincing him
of the justice of their master’s claims to the French crown. Raynaldi has printed this
document, A.D. 1340, ³³34, together with the correspondence which took place between
him and the kings os England and France, by a caret'ul examination of which, much
light might be thrown upon the subject.

‘ . . . versus Flandriam a portu de Yarewelle in antevigilia S. Johannis Baptista.
[J un. 22] transfretavit‚” p. 333.

This is completely established by an entry on the Close Rolls, printed in the
Foedera, ii, 1129, which states that he embarked at Orwell upon Thursday, June ‘22;
and that upon the 24th of that month (not upon the 23d, as the Chronicler of Lauer-
cost was informed), he gained a complete victory over the French fleet in the Swin.

“ Cui rex Angliae . . . scripsit . . . optionem trium eligere‚” p. 334.
The challenge of Edward to Philip, and Philip's letter of refusal, may be seen in
the Foedera, p. 1131.

‘ . . inter ipsum et Philippum praedictum, treuga, mediantibus Cardinalibus, est ac-
cepta‚'' p. 334.

The truce was entered into by the kings of England and France upon 25th Sep-

tember 1340, and Edward arrived at the Tower of London upon 30th November next
